These are personal study notes from *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction* by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto (2nd Edition, MIT Press, 2018).

The notes cover the core ideas, equations, and algorithms from each chapter, transcribed and formatted for review. Mathematical notation follows the textbook closely. Backup diagrams are shown as figures.
